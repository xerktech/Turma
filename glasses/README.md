# @turma/glasses

Even Realities G2 smart-glasses client for Turma: a sessions list, a
scrollable transcript, question answering (`AskUserQuestion`), spawn/kill/
resume of Claude Code sessions, and G2-mic dictation transcribed by the hub's
Whisper integration. `src/app.ts` is a hardware-agnostic controller driven
purely by the `GlassesDisplay` / `Dictation` / `KeyValueStorage` interfaces;
`src/main.ts` wires in either the real Even Hub SDK backend
(`src/display/evenhub.ts`, on-device) or a DOM dev backend
(`src/display/dom.ts`, `npm run dev`), chosen automatically by racing
`waitForEvenAppBridge()` against a short timeout.

### Session screen: bottom bar + focus model

The session screen has no header line — the whole canvas is the transcript
plus a persistent bordered box pinned to the bottom (drawn as a real
bordered container only on hardware; the DOM dev backend stands it in with a
plain-text divider, see `src/display/dom.ts`). The box has two modes: an
**input box** (a dictation target and free-text draft, with a right-corner
status label showing REC/…/Working/Waiting/etc.) and, whenever the session
has a pending `AskUserQuestion` the user hasn't already started dictating an
answer to, a **question sheet** — the question text and numbered options
fill/grow/scroll the same box, plus a trailing "Dictate answer…" row.

Two focus states drive input dispatch (`SessionFocus` in `src/render.ts`):
**transcript focus** (the default on entering the screen) scrolls the
transcript ~2 lines per gesture (`SESSION_SCROLL_STEP`) and a tap either
snaps back to the newest content (if scrolled up) or hands focus to the
bottom box; a double-tap always leaves the session screen. **Bottom focus**
dispatches to whichever mode is active: in the input box, tap starts/stops
in-box dictation and a double-tap opens the context actions menu (Send —
only shown once there's a draft —/Clear/Restart/Kill/Delete/Back); in the
question sheet, scroll moves the highlighted option (including the trailing
"Dictate answer…" row) and tap either sends the highlighted option's 1-based
digit as the answer or, on the trailing row, starts box dictation instead.
The separate full-screen reply and question-answering screens are gone; the
reply screen still exists but only for the spawn/`newPrompt` initial-prompt
flow.

## Dev quickstart

```sh
npm install
npm run mock-hub   # in one terminal — a stdlib Node mock of the hub API
npm run dev         # in another — Vite dev server, DOM backend
```

`npm run dev` opens a keyboard-driven DOM stand-in for the glasses display:
arrow keys scroll, Enter taps, Escape double-taps (back).

The hub URL is entered on the phone login page, alongside the username and
password — the hub is self-hosted, so the app ships no default host. It is
persisted with the credentials (`BridgeStorage` survives Even app restarts), so
it is typed **once per device** and prefilled from then on, including across a
sign-out (which clears the credentials but keeps the hub). A scheme-less host
like `turma.example.com` is fine — `normalizeHubUrl` adds the `https://`.

For local dev, `VITE_HUB_URL` still overrides the target (e.g. to point at the
mock-hub or a LAN hub) and takes precedence over anything stored on the device,
so a stored value can't hijack `npm run dev`. `VITE_HUB_USER` /
`VITE_HUB_PASSWORD` prefill the credentials — set them in a `.env.local` Vite
picks up before running `npm run dev`.

Note the hub you enter must still be listed in `app.json`'s `network`
whitelist: the Even WebView enforces it at the network layer, and it is fixed
at pack time. The login field makes the app forkable (package it with your own
host), not able to reach an arbitrary hub at runtime.

## Simulator

```sh
npm run dev                                       # in one terminal
npm run simulate                                   # in another
```

`npm run simulate` launches `@evenrealities/evenhub-simulator` against the
running dev server. Known gaps versus real hardware: the simulator's
scripted automation surface (`/api/input`) only drives touchpad actions (up/
down/click/double-click) — there's no way to inject synthetic mic audio
through it, so the dictation path can't be exercised via automation and
should be verified on real hardware; and `sysEvent.eventSource` is hardcoded
by the simulator to `TOUCH_EVENT_FROM_GLASSES_R`, so anything keyed on which
touchpad produced an event won't be meaningfully exercised there either.

## Hub requirements

The hub (`turma/server.js`) needs the LiteLLM backend configured for
dictation to work — otherwise the `/audio` WebSocket still accepts
connections but every result reports `unavailable`. STT is served by a LiteLLM
instance, so `LITELLM_URL` (its `/v1` base) + `LITELLM_API_KEY` configure it; the
Whisper endpoint is derived as `${LITELLM_URL}/audio/transcriptions`:

- `LITELLM_URL` — the LiteLLM `/v1` base; supplies STT. Unset disables it.
- `LITELLM_API_KEY` — bearer token for the LiteLLM instance (optional).
- `WHISPER_URL` — override the STT endpoint only if the transcription server
  lives elsewhere than the LiteLLM instance (optional; defaults to the derived
  URL above).
- `WHISPER_API_KEY` — override the STT bearer token (optional; defaults to
  `LITELLM_API_KEY`).
- `WHISPER_MODEL` — model name passed to the Whisper server (optional). This is
  also the LiteLLM alias the gateway routes on (e.g. `voxtral`, `parakeet`).
- `WHISPER_LANGUAGE` — language hint sent with the audio; default `en`. Set it to
  an **empty string** to omit the hint entirely, letting a multilingual model
  (e.g. Parakeet) auto-detect the language.
- `WHISPER_TIMEOUT_MS` — default `30000`.

Set these in DockerOps' compose file alongside the hub's existing env
(`TURMA_USER`/`TURMA_PASSWORD`/`TURMA_TOKEN`/etc.).

The agent side (`agent/hub-agent.py`) has its own tunables for the
transcript-tail and history/input surfaces the glasses client polls:

- `SESSION_TAIL_MSGS` — messages kept in the per-heartbeat transcript tail,
  default `30`.
- `SESSION_TAIL_MSG_CHARS` — chars kept per tailed message, default `500`.
- `SESSION_HISTORY_MSGS` — messages returned by an on-demand `history`
  request, default `200`.
- `SESSION_INPUT_MAX_CHARS` — max chars accepted by an `input` request,
  default `4000`.

## Packaging / sideload

Before `npm run pack`, edit `app.json`'s `permissions[].whitelist` (the
`network` permission) to your own hub's host — both the `https://` and
`wss://` entries — Even Hub enforces this whitelist at the WebView network
layer, so a stale entry means the packaged app simply can't reach your hub.

```sh
npm run pack   # builds dist/ and packages it + app.json into ../turma-hud.ehpk
npx evenhub qr # sideload: generates a QR code the Even app scans to install
```

Use a dedicated hub password for this app rather than reusing your normal
one: HTTP Basic credentials are stored on-device via the bridge's key/value
storage, not just held in memory.

## Publishing to Even Hub

The `npm run pack` / `evenhub qr` flow above is **sideload only** — it installs
the `.ehpk` onto your own paired glasses for development. Getting the app into
the Even Hub store (so it shows up in the Even phone app for install) is a
separate flow that runs through Even Realities' **developer portal**, not the
CLI: `evenhub` has only `init`, `qr`, and `pack` — there is no `publish`/`submit`
command, so the built `.ehpk` is uploaded through the web portal.

1. **Get developer access (one-time gate).** Even Hub is curated — you can't
   upload without being accepted. Apply to the developer program at
   [evenhub.evenrealities.com/application](https://evenhub.evenrealities.com/application)
   and wait for approval (first batch reviewed within ~10 business days,
   response by email). Until you're in, you can only sideload.
2. **Make `app.json` submission-ready.** Bump `version`; confirm
   `min_app_version` / `min_sdk_version`; and — most important — make sure the
   `network` permission `whitelist` lists your real hub host for **both**
   `https://` and `wss://` (e.g. `https://<your-hub-host>` and
   `wss://<your-hub-host>`). Reviewers enforce this whitelist at the WebView
   network layer, so a stale entry means the app can't reach the hub during
   review.
3. **Build + pack** exactly as for sideload:

   ```sh
   npm run build   # tsc + vite → dist/
   npm run pack    # evenhub pack app.json dist -o ../turma-hud.ehpk
   ```

4. **Upload the `.ehpk` in the developer portal** and create/update the app
   entry. This is the step the CLI does not cover.
5. **Manual review.** Every submission goes through a manual review against Even
   Hub's [App Submission & QA checklist](https://hub.evenrealities.com/docs/reference/app-submission);
   anything that fails is returned with a rejection note. The recommended
   pre-flight is the **Beta build** [testing tier](https://hub.evenrealities.com/docs/test)
   (the `.ehpk` distributed to invited testers), because it gives full
   *reviewer parity* — the exact conditions the reviewer sees.

### Private/Beta vs Public

These are two distribution states of the *same* uploaded build, chosen in the
portal:

- **Private / Beta** — distributed only to testers you invite via **email invite
  links**; testers see these under "Beta" plugins. This is the invite-only lane
  and the QA gate before any public listing.
- **Public** — after passing review, listed in the Even Hub store for anyone to
  install (shown under "Public" plugins).

**For Turma HUD specifically, the private/beta lane is the realistic one.**
The app is single-user and self-hosted: it sits behind HTTP Basic auth, and the
`app.json` `network` whitelist is pinned to one host. A public installer has no
reachable hub and no credentials, so a public store listing wouldn't be usable.
The hub URL is now user-configurable at login (it used to be hardcoded), which
was half of what going genuinely public needs; the remaining half is the
`network` whitelist, which the WebView enforces and which is fixed at pack
time — a build can only reach the hosts it was packaged for, whatever the
login page accepts.

## Testing the hub audio path without glasses

```sh
node tests/audio-client.mjs <hubUrl> <user:pass> <file.wav>
```

Fetches a `ws-token`, streams a 16kHz mono s16le WAV/PCM file to the hub's
`/audio` WebSocket in real time, and prints the resulting transcript — a way
to exercise the whole STT path without hardware.

## On-hardware QA checklist

- Whitelist edited to your hub host and the app sideloads/opens OK.
- Signed in via the phone login page (hub URL + username + password) and the
  glasses-display mirror appears. The hub URL must match a host in the
  `app.json` whitelist above, and should be prefilled on any later sign-in.
- Session list matches the web dashboard.
- Each lifecycle action (spawn/kill/start/restart/resume) shows queued (…)
  then converges within ~40s.
- No header line on the session screen — the transcript runs to the top of
  the canvas, with the bordered bottom box the only other thing on screen.
- Scrolling the transcript feels smooth in ~2-line steps per gesture (not a
  full-page jump); tapping (when not scrolled up) focuses the bottom box.
- A pending `AskUserQuestion` turns the bottom box into a sheet: the
  question text and options fill/grow/scroll the box as needed; scrolling
  highlights an option (including a trailing "Dictate answer…" row) and
  tapping a highlighted option sends its digit — verify it lands correctly
  in the RC TUI (the agent appends Enter).
- Dictating into the bottom input box appends to its draft, and Send (from
  the box's double-tap context menu) delivers it to the session.
- The drawn border around the bottom box and real G2-mic dictation are
  hardware-only — the DOM dev backend stands in a plain-text divider and
  can't exercise the mic, so both need on-hardware verification.
- Scrolling a long session to the top loads/prepends history with a
  truncated marker.
- Resuming a closed session from the Resume picker works.
- Spawning a session with a dictated prompt works end-to-end.
- The mic LED is off after every teardown path — stop, cancel, back out,
  backgrounding the app, locking the phone for 5 minutes — and state is
  restored correctly afterward.
- A root double-tap shows the system exit dialog.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server, DOM backend, keyboard-driven (arrows =
  scroll, Enter = tap, Escape = double-tap).
- `npm run build` — typecheck + production build (`dist/`).
- `npm test` / `npm run typecheck` — vitest / `tsc --noEmit`.
- `npm run pack` — builds and packages `dist/` + `app.json` into an
  `.ehpk` via `@evenrealities/evenhub-cli` (one directory up, alongside this
  package).
- `npm run simulate` — launches `@evenrealities/evenhub-simulator` against
  the local dev server (run `npm run dev` first).
- `npm run mock-hub` — a stdlib Node mock of the hub API for manual dev
  without a real hub/agent stack.
- `npm run audio-client` — `node tests/audio-client.mjs`, see above.
